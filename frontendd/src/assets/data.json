      "Apple Scab is a fungal disease which can affect the leaves, fruit, and twigs of flowering, ornamental trees such as crabapple, hawthorn (Venturia inequalis) and pear (V. pirina). Infection on newly emerging leaves is favored by wet and cool spring conditions.",
      "Early symptoms of Apple Scab are brownish-green spots on the leaves or fruit. As the infection progresses, the spots become darker and more prominent and take on a velvety texture due to spore (conidia) formation. Severe infections result in leaf drop off and thinned canopy early, in the summer months."

Remove all dead plant material from the area, placing it into plastic trash bags to prevent further spread of the disease.",
      "Prune the dead or infected branches from apple trees and grapevines, disinfecting the pruning shears with a 70 percent alcohol solution after each cut. Also improve circulation in the center of the plant by pruning away congested branches.",
